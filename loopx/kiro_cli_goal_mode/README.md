# Kiro CLI goal mode

LoopX adapter for [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/) (binary `kiro-cli`) — a
terminal coding agent with skills, steering files, agent configs, hooks, MCP,
and a native goal loop. Kiro CLI ships both halves of a goal-mode host: a goal
primitive *and* a host-enforced iteration budget, so LoopX binds the objective
to the host's own loop instead of pretending the agent merely drives itself.

## Native goal primitive

`/goal [description --validate criteria --agent name --max N] | clear` — the
built-in command, exactly as the host's own hint states it. The host
re-dispatches turns toward the stated objective, judges each iteration against
the validation criteria, and the model must prove completion through the
built-in `goal` tool before the loop ends.

- Iteration budget is host-enforced: default `5`, ceiling `50`. This is the
  one part of the loop LoopX does not have to trust the model for.
- `--validate <criteria>` states what the host checks each iteration; its
  per-iteration result carries `passed` plus `feedback`, so LoopX passes the
  validation it already owns instead of leaving the criteria implicit.
- `--agent <name>` picks which agent config runs the goal. LoopX does not set
  it: the LoopX skill facade must stay reachable from whichever agent the user
  chose.
- `/goal clear` cancels the active goal and `/goal status` reads the current
  one back. The loop also stops in `Exhausted` (budget spent without
  completion) and pauses after 3 consecutive dispatch failures.
- The `goal` tool's `complete` command enforces a completion contract: each
  success criterion needs cited tool output, and belief or narrative
  confidence is explicitly not evidence — the same standard LoopX writeback
  wants.

Probed on `kiro-cli-chat 2.21.1` (app bundle `20260904.123104`; `kiro-cli` and
`kiro-cli-chat` both report `2.21.1`). The command hint, `--validate`/`--agent`/
`--max` flags, the iteration-ceiling rejection message, the `Completed` and
`Exhausted` terminal states, the 3-failure pause, and the per-iteration
`passed`/`feedback` result all come from the shipped binary rather than from
host marketing copy. Re-probe with:

```bash
strings -a "$(readlink -f "$(command -v kiro-cli-chat)")" \
  | grep -ao "/goal \[[^]]*\]"
```

## Native hook seam

Agent configs (`~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json` or `.kiro/agents/<name>.json`)
carry `hooks` for `agentSpawn`, `userPromptSubmit`, `preToolUse`,
`postToolUse`, and `stop`; a `preToolUse` hook can block a tool call by exiting
`2`. That is a real machine-enforceable seam, but **LoopX installs no Kiro
hook today**, so this surface does not claim enforcement. The trigger list is
recorded in `__init__.py` so a future enforced-quota binding has one place to
start from rather than rediscovering it from host docs.

## What this surface is

Kiro CLI discovers global skills from `~/.kiro/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and
workspace skills from `.kiro/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; the default agent carries
both as `skill://` resources, and every discovered skill is invocable as a
`/<skill-name>` slash command with `$ARGUMENTS` expansion. LoopX reaches a
Kiro CLI session through the generated `/loopx` skill facade, and the
activation binds the objective with the native `/goal <task_body> --max <N>`.

Three honest limits, stated in the activation packet:

- **Quota pacing is advisory.** LoopX installs no Kiro hook that intercepts a
  native goal iteration, so `quota should-run` entry is facade guidance the
  agent is instructed to follow — not a host-enforced gate.
- **The loop lives and dies with the session.** The `/goal` loop runs only
  while the CLI session is alive; there is no cross-session daemon, so it
  bounds a live session's segments, not an unattended host loop.
- **A same-named file prompt wins.** Kiro resolves `.kiro/prompts/*.md` and
  `~/.kiro/prompts/*.md` before skills, so a user prompt named `loopx` shadows
  the managed skill. The installer never touches the prompt directories.

## Install

```bash
loopx slash-commands --install --surface kiro-cli
```

Writes the managed LoopX skill facades (`loopx/SKILL.md`,
`loopx-global-*/SKILL.md`, …) into `~/.kiro/skills/` using Kiro's per-skill
directory layout. The host documents no home override for this root
(`KIRO_AGENT_CONFIG_DIR` relocates agent configs only, not skills), so LoopX
offers none either: installs target exactly that path. Managed files carry the
`loopx-managed-slash-command` marker and are refreshed by rerunning the
installer; user-owned files are never overwritten.

## Use

From a Kiro CLI session in a connected project, run `/loopx <complex task>`.
The facade instructs the agent to run:

```bash
loopx start-goal --guided --project . --slash-command-arguments="<task>" --host-surface kiro-cli
```

After todo writeback, bind the generated heartbeat task body with
`/goal <task_body> --max <N>` — with `N` taken from the remaining quota slots
and never above the host ceiling of 50 — pass the validation the todo already
names as `--validate <criteria>` so the host judges each iteration against the
check LoopX will accept, read the loop back with `/goal status`, start every
turn and native goal iteration with `quota should-run` (advisory guidance;
LoopX does not intercept native host iterations), and settle through the
built-in `goal` tool only after LoopX writeback so the cited evidence matches
what LoopX recorded.

Kiro CLI exports `KIRO_SESSION_ID` for every session; it is the stable value a
LoopX thread binding should key on instead of prose.

## Dashboard and Chat agent

Kiro CLI also ships an ACP agent (`kiro-cli acp`), so `loopx dashboard` and
`loopx chat` list **Kiro CLI** as a built-in Agent alongside Codex and Claude
Code. It reuses `loopx.chat_acp.ACPStdioAdapter` rather than a second
transport: probed on 2.21.1, the host answers `initialize` with
`protocolVersion: 1` and `loadSession: true`, and `session/new` returns a
session id, which is exactly what that adapter expects.

```bash
loopx dashboard                                  # Kiro CLI appears when it is on PATH
loopx dashboard --kiro-cli-bin /path/to/kiro-cli # explicit executable
```

Two boundaries this does **not** cross:

- **Read-only by refusal.** LoopX Chat answers every ACP
  `session/request_permission` with `cancelled` and exposes no client host
  tools, so a Kiro tool call that needs approval is refused rather than
  auto-approved. The launch argv carries no `--trust-all-tools`; adding it
  would move that decision out of the owner's hands.
- **Not the governed loop.** A dashboard Chat session is one bounded
  conversation. The `/goal` loop above is entered from a Kiro CLI session
  through the installed skill facade; the two surfaces share the host, not the
  loop.

The built-in id `kiro-cli` is reserved in the owner-local endpoint registry so
a hand-registered endpoint cannot silently shadow it.

## Control-plane identity

Serving an Agent row is not the same as being reachable. Three surfaces resolve
a host by identity, and each one needs Kiro CLI in its table:

- **Endpoint to Goal agent.** A durable Goal agent id is operator-chosen, so
  `chat_actions` collapses both onto a host family: Endpoint `kiro-cli`
  resolves a registered `kiro-worker-1`, the same way `codex` resolves
  `codex-main-control`. Without the row, selecting Kiro CLI in the workspace
  raised `agent_binding_required` for an agent the user did register.
- **Host thread binding.** `KIRO_SESSION_ID` is read for the `kiro-cli` host
  surface, so `start-goal` binds the live session instead of leaving the thread
  unbound.
- **Project skills.** `loopx project-skill --surface kiro-cli` delivers into
  `.kiro/skills`, the workspace skills root Kiro discovers per project.

## Layout

- `__init__.py` — host facts: install surface id, fixed skills root resolution,
  the agent-type catalog entry, the activation extras (native goal command,
  host iteration budget, completion tool, advisory quota boundary), and the
  Chat/ACP launch facts the dashboard's built-in Agent row is built from.
