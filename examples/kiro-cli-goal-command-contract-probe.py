"""Check the projected Kiro goal command against the host's own registry.

LoopX must not claim native command arguments the host does not contract. The
installed CLI advertises its command registry over ACP
(`_kiro.dev/commands/available`), which makes the shape verifiable on any
machine that has the binary instead of transcribed from documentation.

This probe is replayable and public-safe: it starts the host as an ACP stdio
agent, reads the advertised `/goal` entry, and compares it with what
`loopx.kiro_cli_goal_mode` projects. It exits 0 and reports `skipped` when the
binary is absent, so it is safe in environments without the host.
